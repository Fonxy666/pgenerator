# P-Generator - .NET WPF application for password store
 Pgenerator is a petproject for myself. It's a password storage application. 

# Stack
 I used c# 7.0 for developing, and amazon rds(MSSQL). 

# Project Status
This project is only a fun project, to learn wpf application a little deeper. There is a release for the application, which is not working, because i disabled the database, because im not using this at all.
